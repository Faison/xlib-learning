/**
 * Practice of the first video in the YouTubes.
 *
 * The goals of the first video are as follows:
 *   - Compile barebones C program using a Makefile.
 *   - Open a window, make it display on the screen for a few seconds (using sleep).
 *   - Make the window stay open until you click the close button.
 *   - Make sure to clean up after ourselves, shooting for 0 leaks.
